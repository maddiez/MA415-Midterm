whether or not violations correlate with accidents
most typical accidents: industry (OCC), source of accident (source, environ, human)
want occupation w accidents, based on degree & number of occurences
companies that dont make changes after complaints / etc, unsafe to work at?
make data look more presentable

OSHA - Occupational Safety and Heath Administration
Priorities: Imminent danger (causes death/serious harm), Catastrophes/Fatal accidents (3+ employees death of hospitilization), Complaints/Referrals (employee complaints of unsafe conditions), Programmed Inspections (OSHA selects industries based on injury rates, citation history, toxic substance exposure, random)

Violations: OtherThanSerious (will not cause death/serious harm but unsafe), Serious (big prob. of serious harm), Willful (employer knows violation, hazardous condition), Repeated (similar violation w re-inspection), FailureToABate (not correcting prior violation)

1. Each variable forms a column.
2. Each observation forms a row.
3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

FILES INCLUDED:
	
	Osha.dbf - main table with company name, address, date of inspection, etc. 
		If you get the entire country, there's a number after the 
		word OSHA, since it's too big to put on one CD. (not necessary)
	Viol.dbf - violations from each inspection. If you get the entire 
		country, there's a number after the word VIOL, since it's 
		too big to put on one CD. (yes)
	Accid.dbf - details about accident victims (yes)
	Hazsub.dbf - hazardous substances involved (yes)
	Debt.dbf - status of debt (not necessary)
	History.dbf - outlines a history of any changes in penalty (not neccesary)
	Admpay.dbf - a record of collecting administrative fees or penalties (not neccesary)
	Prog.dbf - special programs the inspection might be involved in (potentially useful)
	Relact.dbf - whether the inspection is related to another inspection or other action (useful, if inspection is related to other action, can see whether it has been fixed)
	Optinfo.dbf - optional information

Viol Type - O = other
						R = repeat
						S = serious
						U = unclassified
						W = willful
Viol Type A - initial assesment violation
STD - Federal or state standard cited - use subset(std, STATE == "MA"), determine none
Abate 
Instances -	Number of instances of violation of standard related event
Rec- related event code
						A = FAT/CAT (fatality/catastrophe), accident
						B = 
						C = complaint
						D = 
						F = 
						I = imminent danger
						R = related event code
						S =
						V = variance
Num Exposed - # employees affected
Abate Done - Maybe can see if companies care about violations and have done abatement?
            X = abatement, PPE, report completed
						E = abatement, PPE, plan, report not completed,
							employer out of business
						W = abatement, PPE, plan, report not completed,
							worksite changed
						S = abatement, PPE, plan, report not complete, ad
							discretion
